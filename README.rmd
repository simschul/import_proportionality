# Import Proportionality Assumption in MRIO

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repository contains all code to reproduce the results from our paper on 'Relaxing the import proportionality assumption in multi-regional input-output anlysis' published in the Journal of Economic Structures. 

The individual scripts should be run according to their numbering. Note, that for running the script you need the 2011 table from EXIOBASE Version 3.4 in the industry-by-industry version. You can find it on https://exiobase.eu/. 

For questions you can contact me via [e-mail](mailto:s.pedro@gmx.de) or raise an issue on github. 


All code was tested with the following setup:

```{r, include=FALSE}
source('./packages.R')
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```
